        The `app_label` positional argument is the label of the application being migrated.

        `model_name` is set by most migration operations to the value of model._meta.model_name (the lowercased version
        of the model __name__) of the model being migrated. Its value is None for the RunPython and RunSQL operations
        unless they provide it using hints.

        hints are used by certain operations to communicate additional information to the router.

        When `model_name` is set, hints normally contains the model class under the key 'model'. Note that it may be a
        historical model, and thus not have any custom attributes, methods, or managers. You should only rely on _meta.

        This method can also be used to determine the availability of a model on a given database.

        makemigrations always creates migrations for model changes, but if allow_migrate() returns False, any migration
        operations for the `model_name` will be silently skipped when running migrate on the db. Changing the behavior
        of allow_migrate() for models that already have migrations may result in broken foreign keys, extra tables, or
        missing tables. When makemigrations verifies the migration history, it skips databases where no app is allowed
        to migrate.
