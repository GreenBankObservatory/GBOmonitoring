High-Level Milestones
=====================

The final vision of a fully-automated, centralized monitoring suite could be accomplished with the following milestones.

#. Understand the problem

    * Create a list of everything that is currently monitored or capable of being monitored
    * Define a set of core groupings of the monitoring issues
    * Categorize the list according to the decided categories 
  
#. Constrain the problem

    * List development avenues for groups of monitoring problems
    * Assign priorities to the development avenues 
  
#. Develop a proof-of-concept

    * Identify a few high-priority items with known instances of historical error
    * Develop algorithms for those issues which would have caught their errors as early as possible 
  
#. Expand proof-of-concept code into monitoring modules for similar data
#. Centralize monitoring modules
#. Migrate existing monitoring modules to the centralized location in order of priority
#. Get people to use the centralized location
