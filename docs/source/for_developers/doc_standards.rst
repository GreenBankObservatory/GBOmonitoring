Mermaid Diagrams
================

Diagrams can be directly in these text files by using the `sphinxcontrib-mermaid` package. Here's an example:

.. mermaid::

    flowchart LR
        A[Item 1] --> B[Item 2]
        B --> C[Item 3]

To learn more, see the `package documentation <https://sphinxcontrib-mermaid-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Mermaid also offers an `online editor <https://mermaid.live>`_ which can be used to design diagrams.
